            <p class="definition">Pathophysiology-the disordered physiological processes associated with disease or injury</p>
            <p>When the coronavirus first appeared in December of 2019 it was named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV-2.  After some studies, the coronavirus was perceived to have started via a zoonotic transmission associated with the seafood market and then in the subsequent outbreak of human-to-human transmission is seen to have a major role.  Since human-to-human transmission has a large role in the spread and in hopes to “flatten the curve” many countries instated stay at home orders for their citizens, which included the shutdown of nonessential business, social distancing of six feet, and mandatory wearing of masks.  The purpose of masks, social distancing and quarantining is to stop the spread of the symptoms associated with the virus on those infected.</p>
            <p>When a person becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2 the virus attacks and takes over cells to multiply and invade the person.  Coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses that are divided into four genera: α, β, γ, and δ. The difference between the four genera is how their genomic structure varies but only α and β coronaviruses infect mammals.  Most common colds and croups are classified as α coronaviruses whereas COVID-19 is a β coronavirus.  When the virus enters the host its life cycle consists of five steps: attachment, penetration, biosynthesis, maturation, and release.  SARS-CoV-2 breaks into a cell to cooperate the cells gene used to copy DNA and RNA.  The virus uses protein spikes that are protruding from its surface to attach to the cells within the new host from the previous one.</p>
            <p>When you are exposed to COVID-19 the first encounter of the virus will most likely be in the ACE2 receptors, which are the protein gates on human cells or the docking site of new DNA and RNA, within your nose or throat.  After the virus has attached and penetrated a few initial host cells it starts the biosynthesis process where it starts to make copies of itself that can mature and then be released to infect the rest of the body.  As the virus spreads throughout the body, it attacks and takes over some of the bodies most crucial systems and most patients dies from multi-organ failure.  Yet some people who have contracted the virus go asymptomatic and can transmit it without knowing making it important to mask up when out in public.  Once encountering some who has COVID-19 it takes time before the symptoms show themselves, if they do that is.</p>

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported - ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.  Symptoms may appear <span class="bold">2-14 days after exposure to the virus.</span></p>

        <h3>Vaccination Process</h3>
            <p>Throughout the last several months many companies have been battling each other in the race to get their vaccine out first.  There were several challenges in developing a vaccine that would both be safe and effective against protecting us from receiving the virus.  There was, however, three different companies that managed to develop an effective vaccine and be able to distribute it worldwide.</p>
