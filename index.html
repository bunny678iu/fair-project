                Hello!! My name is Morgan Guenther and I currently graduated from Gilmanton High School.  Throughout my years I enrolled in a wide variety of classes and took part in several clubs, activities, and organizations.
                <br>
                <br>
                I plan on attending the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater in the fall to study marketing.  With this major I hope to one day work for a company in the marketing sector with my own team.  This career would help me continue to be a leader for those around me.

                My goal for this webpage is to share more about me and who I am as a person.  I also wanted to tell a story about what has happened in 2020 because it will definately be a year none of us will forget.  We all have been impacted by the events of last year, me included, and I feel it is important to be aware of everything that has happened.
                <br>
                <br>
                The past year for me has been one full of ups and downs but I have made the best out of it in every way possible and in turn have learned more about myself.  Learning how to cope with certain changes and understanding that even the little things in life play such a major role in who we are along with how we go through each day.  We all take each new challenge on differently but this past year has been and will be one that no one will ever forget.
